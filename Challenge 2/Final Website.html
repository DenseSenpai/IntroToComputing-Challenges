    <h3> The History of Indie Games</h3>
    <img src="main2.gif" alt="main2" class="move-right">
    <p class="left-align">
        The history of indie games is a fascinating journey that traces its roots to the early days of the video game industry. In the 1970s and 1980s, when the industry was in its infancy, games were often developed by small teams or even individuals due to the limited resources and technology available. These early pioneers laid the groundwork for what would later become the indie game movement.
        As technology advanced, larger game development studios became the norm, dominating the industry with blockbuster titles. However, in the late 20th century and early 21st century, the rise of digital distribution platforms and the democratization of game development tools played a pivotal role in the resurgence of indie games. Developers could now create and distribute their games without the need for significant financial backing or traditional publishing deals.   
        The indie game movement gained momentum as developers embraced the opportunity to explore innovative ideas, experiment with unique gameplay mechanics, and tell unconventional stories.</p1></div>
